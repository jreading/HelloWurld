Interesting stuff coming out about js Classes in Alex Russell's [blog post](http://infrequently.org/2012/04/class-warfare/).

I'm a of [fan](http://hellowurld.heroku.com/blog/2012/04/19/responsive-modules/) of [classes](https://github.com/jreading/JsModuleBoilerplate) for some things in js (modular widgets, mostly). So I hope this fight is not over. Max/Min is all I really want anyway.

Here's a great response by [Malte Ubl](https://plus.google.com/u/1/116910304844117268718/posts/WRWBXpi5e2f).
